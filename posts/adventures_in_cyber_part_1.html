<h1 class="title">Adventures In Security Part 1</h1>
<p>
I have been getting increasingly interested in <i>Security</i> for the past year. I believe the moment that triggered the interest was when I was attending a Linux user group last year and the night&rsquo;s subject was <i>Cyber Security</i>. The presenter had been in the field for a very long time and had done many things that were intriguing to me, so I slowly started to learn more about it. I settled on learning more about <i>Penetration Testing</i>, since I have most of my experience in creating web applications which in the past were&#x2026; erm&#x2026; not so secure.  
</p>

<p>
At first I started with the brute force way of learning. I got into <a href="http://hackthebox.eu">HackTheBox.eu</a> with a little guessing (since you just can&rsquo;t sign up for an account). From there, I tried to pop some boxes. I ended up popping&#x2026; none. It was seriously disheartening, but then again, why did I expect to just jump in and immediately be able to exploit?
</p>

<p>
What I was exposed to in those first few hours were pretty valuable. I was following a professional pentester (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMGsnPSm8iw">IppSec</a>) on YouTube get into retired HackTheBox machines and learning all of the places where I had knowledge gaps. One huge area I need to focus on is Networking. It&rsquo;s pretty interesting how a programmer who has specialized in TCP/IP based applications could be as ignorant to the protocol as I think I am. But not for long. 
</p>

<p>
I knew that I needed to get some sort of training, so I did from Udemy. I am currently enrolled in 5 courses, 2 of which are very network based (<a href="https://www.udemy.com/wireshark/learn/v4/overview">The Complete Wireshark Course</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nmap-ethical-hacking-course-network-security/learn/v4/overview">The Complete Nmap Ethical Hacking Course</a>). These both look very well organized and get great ratings. The rest of the courses are pretty specific to pentesting. I started with one called <a href="https://www.udemy.com/kali-linux-hands-on-penetration-testing-labs/learn/v4/overview">Kali Linux Hands on Penetration Testing Labs</a> which I am enjoying despite the minor flaw in one of the vulnhub VMs. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about configuring networks on virtual machines for safety.

I would have loved to install VMWare Fusion (since I am on a Mac), but I don&rsquo;t have that kind of cash to slang around for exploration.

<h3 id="sec-1-2">Installed Kali Linux</h3>

This is the distro that is packed with tons of awesome tools for pentesting.

Basic movement and copy/pasting for better use of my time. From here, I opened a can of worms.

<h3 id="sec-1-4">Installed the Fish shell so I could stop typing so many of the commands</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
This is my first experience with fish and I already love it, but I also already hit one of the pain points of it not being POSIX. I&rsquo;ve read that there is a way to make it so, but I didn&rsquo;t want to waste any more time. The best features of fish are autosuggest and the help that pops up when you list the suggestions. One could learn a lot from just hitting tab. I think I am going to be switching to fish as my full-time shell. That is, when I am not using Eshell.
</p>

<p>
Try the <a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#tut_why_fish">Fish Tutorial</a> and you will see how magical it is. Spoiler alert: you type <code>fish_config</code> and a browser opens up where you have a GUI to configure your shell. So awesome.

<h3 id="sec-1-5">Installed Emacs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
I really tried not to install Emacs on Kali, but tmux, fish, etc, were not cutting it. I wanted to be able to sling text around in a buffer and work with it. The only solid way I know how to do this is in Emacs. 
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, you have to kind of hack Kali to let you install Emacs. It took me a while to get things right, and they are not completely where they need to be, but it sure is better using Emacs while performing pentests now.

I am looking forward to getting into more of the labs. At the moment, I really like the HackTheBox experience over downloading a VM locally to exploit it. Hopefully, I will get to pop my own box in the coming weeks with the knowledge that I gain from these courses. I plan on documenting my progress.
