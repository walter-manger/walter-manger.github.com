For the past couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve been learning a lot of new things and
coding at the seat of my pants as a result of my growing Go coding
responsibilities at work. I love learning new things, but there&rsquo;s just
one problem: I can&rsquo;t really tell you what I&rsquo;ve learned. All I know is
that some feature is shipped and tests were written and people are using
it. It&rsquo;s functional. It&rsquo;s great that I shipped, but what would put the
icing on the cake is if would never have to relearn the things I had to
in these past couple of weeks.
</p>

<p>
During this time period, it appears that I&rsquo;ve also gotten worse at
tracking tasks and the time that I spent on them than I was in the
previous weeks.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5061a13">
<p>
Sometimes while we are working, especially in the software industry, we
are rapidly learning things to get something shipped, but we never
revisit until the next time a similar task comes our way. Then, it&rsquo;s off
to SO or better to get the same answer we got last time. Sometimes we
don&rsquo;t even recognize that it&rsquo;s the same problem that we solved last
time. We are so focused on finding the answer that we don&rsquo;t take time to
truly understand the problem. We are caught up in churning out the code.
</p>

<p>
Think about what happens to someone that operates like this full-time
for years. That person never progresses past the point of knowing where
to get the answer.

<p>
Don&rsquo;t let your inner project manager deprive you from getting better at
things. Take the time to learn things from reliable sources. Keep a
journal of the things you are working on and what you are learning.
Revisit this jounal at the end of each week. The journal does not have
to be very detailed, just enough to trigger the same synapse that you
had when you discovered the answer.
