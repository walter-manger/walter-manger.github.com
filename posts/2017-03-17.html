<h1 class="title">Installing Linux Mint &amp; CLI Wonderment</h1>
<p>
I decided to install Linux Mint 18 on my old laptop. I really wanted to
know what it was like to have a Linux as a primary OS. Initially, I
installed a Linux on a VM and having it there was handy, but I found
myself not opening the VM. With it installed as my primary OS, I am
forced into using it. I&rsquo;ve always been really curious about Linux and
how to harness the power &#x2013; it&rsquo;s just hard to commit to learning a
particular OS when it is not your primary.

<p>
Just before I took the plunge, I picked up a physical copy of <i>The Linux
Command Line</i> from the local library (it is now late). There is so much
great information in that book. You learn little things about the
built-in utilities and how basically the OS is an IDE. In the first
chapter, the author writes about a scenario where two developers (C++ vs
Bash) looking at the same problem solved it in very different ways.
Spoiler alert: the Bash approach was orders of magnitude less code. This
was the main draw to learning more about Linux.
</p>

<p>
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I can get around Linux pretty well. I just wanted to
dig more into the utilities that are available to become more efficient
on the command line.

<p>
I&rsquo;ve had pretty good success getting my development environment up and
running on Linux. I even scripted out some of the configuration so it
can be replicated on other Debian based systems. At this point, I don&rsquo;t
see a reason to go elsewhere. In fact, I like this environment so much,
I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> want to go elsewhere. That&rsquo;s the dangerous thing. I&rsquo;ve always
thought that one should be as OS agnostic as possible, but I think when
you get exposed to the powerful tools that live in Linux, going outside
this environment is difficult. I know that OSX and now Windows 10 have
proper support for Bash, but it is here now and it is free.

<h2 id="sec-3">What About Audio &amp; Other Things?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
That is something I am working to try to get to parity with. Currently,
OSX and Windows have great support for Audio applications. Not to
mention, the VSTs that I&rsquo;ve recently used are so much better than they
used to be. I am not opposed to maybe dual-booting for that particular
need. We&rsquo;ll see what comes from my digging.
