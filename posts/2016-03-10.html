<h1 class="title">Side Project Scheduling</h1>
</header><p>
I&rsquo;ve recently starting getting up earlier to work on side projects. When
I say earlier, I mean, at about 4:15AM. This should give me a good 1.5
hours to work on something and get to a point that I can commit
something meaningful before I have to start getting ready for my day.
The goal is to get that number down to something like 40-45 minutes so I
can spend the other half doing something else like reading or
researching new technologies. What I am finding is for that 1.5 hours to
be effective, planning the night before is pretty important. I&rsquo;ve spent
a few mornings getting up to speed for a half hour. It&rsquo;s really
important to eliminate that discovery time.

When I first wanted to learn Go, I started making a game that could be
played in Slack in the form of an integration. It is called
<a href="https://github.com/walter-manger/slack-battle">Slack Battle</a>. What I thought would be easy to slap together in a night or so is turning out
to be a little more difficult than I&rsquo;d planned. Creating games is
difficult &#x2013; even really simple ones. Add the requirement for playing
games over HTTP and the need for some sort of persistence, and the
difficulty increases.

The project was first created with Google App Engine, but coming back to
the project after it had aged a bit, I thought that it would be so much
simpler not being boxed into what GAE offers. Really, the only thing GAE
was providing me was a datastore. I decided to use Mongolab instead.
Why? Because it doesn&rsquo;t really box me in. It feels as if I had an
instance of Mongo running locally.
