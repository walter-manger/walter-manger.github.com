<h1 class="title">Emacs This Week - Week 18</h1>
</header><p>
I&rsquo;ve decided that I am going to write about the things that I&rsquo;ve done to
make my life easier with Emacs. I will attempt to write weekly, if, of
course, there is enough content to warrant a post.
</p>

<p>
Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve got so far: (this is slightly cheating since I have not
posted in a couple of weeks)
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge0123f2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge0123f2">Started easing into using Org-Mode for planning And tracking</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge0123f2">
<p>
I am starting to use org-mode&rsquo;s todos and agenda pretty heavily. There&rsquo;s
still a way to go as I don&rsquo;t have a great workflow yet. Basically, my
flow consists of this:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Attend a stand-up at work</li>

<li>Decide on what I may work on that day, then create and schedule those
items</li>

<li>Track time against those items and mark them done when they are</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1597a7c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org1597a7c">I think an improved workflow would be</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1597a7c">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Get all of the work items into my org file immediately when I know
about them</li>

<li>Write any notes that I may think of for each of the tasks</li>

<li>Create checkbox items to break down the tasks</li>

<li>In the beginning of each day, select the items that I think I could
get done that day, reviewing the notes as needed</li>

<li>At the end of the day, move any tasks that need to be moved on to the
next day</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge8dcaa9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge8dcaa9">Added the ability to track time to Harvest with Harvest.el</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge8dcaa9">
<p>
I&rsquo;ve switched my Agenda time tracking to also track to harvest. I also
learned more about elisp as a result of fixing a bug in Harvest.el.
Elisp is pretty awesome :)
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge78f5d4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge78f5d4">Started using Go-Mode</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge78f5d4">
<p>
This last sprint I took on some significant Go work, which prompted me
learning more about the Go-Mode package that I&rsquo;ve had installed for a
while now. I started taking advantage of things like <code>C-c C-j</code> (jump to
definition) and <code>M-*</code> (pop-mark to get back to the place I jumped from).
I am not completely happy with the bindings here, but it isn&rsquo;t killing
me. I liked using <code>C-c C-d</code> for Godoc in the minibuffer. For some
reason, my hook to <code>gofmt</code> upon saving stopped working one day&#x2026; not
sure why. I used <code>(ff-get-other-file)</code> to find the corresponding
<code>*_test.go</code> file. Sometimes it didn&rsquo;t work as there were some mismatched
file names &#x2013; it&rsquo;s not Go-Mode&rsquo;s fault.

<div id="outline-container-orga55a8b6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga55a8b6">Relied more on eshell for CLIs that were not so <i>chatty</i></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga55a8b6">
<p>
Eshell has been great for most everything I do, however. When using
CLI&rsquo;s that produce large amounts of output, eshell seems to get bogged
down. I have not looked into why this is happening. I suspect that it
has something to do with the amount of history that I keep in the
buffer. I&rsquo;ll investigate some other time. For now, anything that I know
is going to barf out thousands of lines is going to have to be performed
in my iTerm 2. Along these lines, when I am executing unit tests, eshell
does not get bogged down, but the output isn&rsquo;t really that pretty. I&rsquo;ll
need to investigate this too.

<div id="outline-container-org28813f7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org28813f7">Stayed in Magit 90% of the time when using Git</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org28813f7">
<p>
I am really starting to love Magit. There are just a few things that I
need to get better at that really have nothing to do with Magit per se.
One area that bit me last week was dealing with a bad merge. I was
unable to get myself out of the mess without going back to Tower and
Beyond Compare for diffs. Beyond Compare&rsquo;s interface for performing
merges is pretty hard to move away from. All in due time. I&rsquo;ve achieved
the goal of not having to use my mouse at all when dealing with Git 90%
of the time &#x2013; that&rsquo;s good enough for now.

<div id="outline-container-org1c0165f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1c0165f">What still needs work?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1c0165f">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>General Editing Efficiency

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There are times where I find my self pressing <code>jjjjjjjkkkk</code> (I use
evil) to move around the document, when I could be either using
search or something like avy (which I have not installed yet).</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Better eshell Configuration

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I don&rsquo;t have any of my Zsh settings available. I know that there
is a way to make this happen, I just have not had the time. Eshell
colors are not awesome at this point. I am not sure if I can fix
this completely, but I&rsquo;ll research it.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Org-Mode / Planning Improvements

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Work on getting better at planning in general. Allocate time for
managing tasks. Planning make for a better overall experience.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Start Estimating Effort in Org-Mode Tasks

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Learn more about estimating time and developing weekly reports &#x2013;
like Sacha Chua does.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Daily Reflection

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Start spending 10 minutes at the end of the day to reflect on the
things that I did that day and keep it in a Work Journal (I&rsquo;ll
need a capture for that).</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Harness Org-Mode&rsquo;s Habits

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Repetitive tasks, such as the Daily Reflection above, should be
defined as a repetitive task in my Org file so I can track how
often I do reflect.</li>
</ul></li>
