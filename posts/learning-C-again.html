<h1 class="title">Learning C/C++ Again</h1>
</header><p>
I&rsquo;ve been wanting to get back into C/C++ for a while now, but I was
unsure how I would go about creating a learning environment. There are
many tutorials available out there, but I tend to lean toward structured
learning &#x2013; like the way you would learn in a classroom setting. I
quickly searched on Reddit and some other outlets about the best books
to buy, but after reviewing a few, I was left empty handed. As you can
probably imagine, the book that gets recommended the most is K&amp;R&rsquo;s <i>The
C Programming Language</i>. I think that it is a great recommendation, but
I read that book cover to cover a few years ago. I was looking for
something different as most tech books of this nature get boring quickly
and most definitely if you are re-reading it.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5c9a656">
<p>
The other day I went to a near by <i>Goodwill</i> just to see what kind of
books would be available and sure enough, gathered among diet books and
romantic novels was:
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/C-How-Program-2nd-Edition/dp/0132261197"><i>C How
To Program 2nd Edition</i></a> by <i>Dietel &amp; Dietel</i>. This book is likely out
of date with best practices for modern C, but what I was looking for was
a thorough <i>introduction</i> to C/C++. This looks like it is what I was
looking for. It has pretty good reviews on <i>Amazon</i> too. I plan on
picking up some books on modern best practices after this introduction.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org97a56b2">
<p>
I don&rsquo;t intend on spending too much time hammering through the entire
book. Just a refresher for the first few chapters by skimming through
and writing some of the more difficult programs for each chapter.
Pointers are presented in Chapter 7, so that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll likely slow
down. I know pointers, but my working knowledge of them is lacking. My
previous exposure to pointers and working experience in <i>Golang</i> is
useful in some ways, but <i>C/C++</i> pointers are pretty different.

<p>
What I hope to do is get good enough with <i>C/C++</i> so that it is easier
to read source for things like the <i>Linux</i> kernel and general <i>GNU</i>
utilities. Eventually, I&rsquo;d like to contribute to these types of things.
Hopefully this first step is a step in the right direction.
