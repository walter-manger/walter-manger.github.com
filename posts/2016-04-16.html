<h1 class="title">Your Software Developer Career Needs Attention</h1>
</header><p>
I&rsquo;ve just finished reading the majority of the pages in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-software-developers-manual/dp/1617292397/ref=sr%5C_1%5C_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1460841226&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=softskills"><i>Soft Skills</i></a>  by John Sonmez. This book is filled with
little chapters dedicated to managing your career as a software
developer. What&rsquo;s more is he doesn&rsquo;t just write about the things that
pertain directly to developing software. He writes about productivity,
finance, fitness, and spirit, which all apply to any career. I can&rsquo;t say
that 100% of the book was enlightening, since some of it is common
sense, but what did help in the areas where enlightenment wasn&rsquo;t
achieved were the <i>Taking Action</i> sections at the end of each chapter.
Coming in at 430 pages and 71 chapters, there is a lot of action to
take. I have to admit, taking action on at least 71 things is a bit
overwhelming, but the way the book works is: you create your own path.
With this book, John is giving you a set of tools that he&rsquo;s used in his
career to shape your career. Essentially, you don&rsquo;t have to take action
every place he suggests it. You can focus on the areas that are
suffering in your career now and come back to the book for guidance in
other areas as your career grows.
</p>

<p>
The single most important take-away from this book is: being a
professional is entirely up to you. You are in charge of your career.
You are the boss of your own private corporation, even if you have a
boss that pays your bills. Even if you don&rsquo;t feel like you are, you are
indeed providing a service. Make sure that you are providing your <i>best</i>
service and it is reliable. Also, make sure that people are aware of
your &rsquo;brand&rsquo;. Not thinking this way is actually dangerous &#x2013; I&rsquo;ll
discuss that later.
</p>

<p>
Getting into this mindset helps everyone involved. As an employee, you
can guarantee that you are producing your best work because you are
focused on helping to build your &rsquo;brand&rsquo;. Employers and management
benefit because having developers with this mindset ensures reliable
results &#x2013; it&rsquo;s a part of their <i>service</i>. A developer&rsquo;s <i>brand</i> will
always be more important than the company that they are working for (if,
of course, the company is not his or her own).
</p>

<p>
The content in this book will make you look at how, where, and why you
work differently.

<h3 id="org389d906">1. Teaching</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org389d906">
<p>
I need to focus on teaching what I&rsquo;ve learned. Blogging can be a form of
teaching, and one of the reasons I&rsquo;ve started this blog was to teach,
but there are more effective ways. Blogging is mostly a one-way street
with occasional feedback. Presenting can be by far the most effective
with a really tight feedback loop. What I&rsquo;d like to focus on is
occasionally presenting at local user groups and more frequently than
that use blogging and screen-casting. Blogging and screen-casting more
frequently than presenting offers a few advantages. First, it&rsquo;s a way to
refine and test the waters on a particular subject. Secondly, it
actually gives you a starting point for a subject you&rsquo;d like to present
on. I am currently a member of a few meetup groups. I plan on presenting
something in the coming months.

<h3 id="org4b59dad">2. Learning</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4b59dad">
<p>
I need to learn more efficiently. Oddly enough, the ways that I used to
learn things were pretty solid, but the techniques that I used took way
too much time. <i>Soft Skills</i> contains a 10 step process for learning
things quickly. I am currently trying out this technique. I am also
looking at other techniques for future experimentation. The chapters in
the learning section of <i>Soft Skills</i> were valuable to me because they
made me question the way that I approach learning something. It has
sparked a new excitement in me of the possibilities to hack my own
learning process.

<h3 id="org8c1fa35">3. Productivity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8c1fa35">
<p>
There are entire days where I sit typing at the keyboard and churning
out code and yet I feel like I&rsquo;ve accomplished nothing. My estimations
have always been off to an extent and my time tracking has always been
an afterthought. The chapters on productivity in <i>Soft Skills</i> have shed
some light on the areas that I could improve on to become better at
estimation. Time tracking inherently makes estimations more accurate,
which makes you more reliable, and in turn, makes your <i>brand</i> better.
I&rsquo;ve started looking into techniques to make this happen &#x2013; Pomodoro,
GTD, etc.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org737fa11">
<p>
It&rsquo;s taken me about a month of reading it for a few hours a week and I
believe it is time well-spent. If you&rsquo;re getting the message, you&rsquo;ll
never look at your job or your profession the same way.
