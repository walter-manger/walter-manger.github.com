It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to any Golang , but I got the itch this weekend to setup my Doom Emacs to do so.
Most of the time I don&amp;rsquo;t want a full-blown IDE experience as having all the bells and whistles of that type of environment can be distracting. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;d like to turn on features as I need them.</description></item><item><title>Supporting Multiple Git/Github Accounts</title><link>https://wmanger.com/articles/supporting-multiple-github-accounts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://wmanger.com/articles/supporting-multiple-github-accounts/</guid><description>Photo by Marcin Szmigiel from Pexels
Many times, especially when working as a freelance developer, you&amp;rsquo;ll need access to multiple Github repositories. Most likely, you will be using different Github accounts, so you&amp;rsquo;ll need to tell git which account to use. To do this, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to configure your ~/.ssh/config and ~/.gitconfig accordingly.
I won&amp;rsquo;t go into great detail in this post, as there already is really good documentation here on how to configure ssh for Github.</description></item><item><title>On becoming a Certified Kubernetes Application Developer</title><link>https://wmanger.com/articles/on-becoming-a-ckad/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://wmanger.com/articles/on-becoming-a-ckad/</guid><description>Over the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been head-down on learning more about Kubernetes. To help solidify this learning, I thought that it would be a good idea to add some icing on the cake and attempt the CKAD exam.
I am glad to report that as of today, I am a Certified Kubernetes Application Developer.
My study strategy wasn&amp;rsquo;t really unique, but I&amp;rsquo;ll describe it below.
Don&amp;rsquo;t Waste Time Don&amp;rsquo;t waste time wondering how long it takes or how much effort it takes to be ready for the exam.</description></item><item><title>The Pragmatic Programmer</title><link>https://wmanger.com/book-notes/revisiting-the-pragmatic-programmer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 23:39:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://wmanger.com/book-notes/revisiting-the-pragmatic-programmer/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is probably one of the most classic programming books that is frequently recommended to programmers by programmers.
I catagorize this type of book as &lt;em>Programmer&amp;rsquo;s Self-Help&lt;/em>.
Some will find it helpful, others look for more actionable advice.
I read this when I was about 2 years into my software engineering career.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
