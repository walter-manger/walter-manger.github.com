  It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to any Golang, but I got the itch this weekend to setup my Doom Emacs to do so.
Most of the time I don&amp;rsquo;t want a full-blown IDE experience as having all the bells and whistles of that type of environment can be distracting. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;d like to turn on features as I need them.</description>

      <description>Over the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been head-down on learning more about Kubernetes. To help solidify this learning, I thought that it would be a good idea to add some icing on the cake and attempt the CKAD exam.
I am glad to report that as of today, I am a Certified Kubernetes Application Developer.
My study strategy wasn&amp;rsquo;t really unique, but I&amp;rsquo;ll describe it below.
Don&amp;rsquo;t Waste Time Don&amp;rsquo;t waste time wondering how long it takes or how much effort it takes to be ready for the exam.</description>

  Many times, especially when working as a freelance developer, you&amp;rsquo;ll need access to multiple Github repositories. To do this, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to configure your ~/.ssh/config and ~/.gitconfig accordingly.
I won&amp;rsquo;t go into great detail in this post, as there already is really good documentation here on how to configure ssh for Github.
After generating the needed ssh keys, I setup my ~/.</description>

      <title>Shipping Efficiently</title>

      <description>If you find yourself writing a lot of code for a feature, stop and try to organize your changes into smaller, manageable chunks.
Sure, it takes some discipline, but stopping to actually plan out your work before you do it is worth it because it gives you the headspace to put some genuine thought behind the feature.
There&amp;rsquo;s one caveat &amp;ndash; your company has to appreciate this genuine thought.</description>

      <title>The Pragmatic Programmer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is probably one of the most classic programming books that is frequently recommended to programmers by programmers.
I catagorize this type of book as &lt;em&gt;Programmer&amp;rsquo;s Self-Help&lt;/em&gt;.
Some will find it helpful, others look for more actionable advice.
I read this when I was about 2 years into my software engineering career.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Cloud architecture is a great way to ship safe, cost effective, resilient, and scalable applications.
Here are some tips from the trenches to help your team embrace the cloud.
Trust Your Cloud Provider If you are going to be using the cloud, you need to trust that your provider&amp;rsquo;s services are going to be operational. Writing code defensively or testing that a particular service is working is a waste of time.</description>
