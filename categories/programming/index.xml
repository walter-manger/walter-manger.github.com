&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to get back into C/C++ for a while now, but I was unsure how I would go about creating a learning environment. There are many tutorials available out there, but I tend to lean toward structured learning &amp;ndash; like the way you would learn in a classroom setting. I quickly searched on Reddit and some other outlets about the best books to buy, but after reviewing a few, I was left empty handed. As you can probably imagine, the book that gets recommended the most is K&amp;amp;R&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The C Programming Language&lt;/em&gt;. I think that it is a great recommendation, but I read that book cover to cover a few years ago. I was looking for something different as most tech books of this nature get boring quickly and most definitely if you are re-reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;goodwill-ftw:881acfa8d42cd3861f49dfee4e7fd53d&#34;&gt;Goodwill FTW&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I went to a near by &lt;em&gt;Goodwill&lt;/em&gt; just to see what kind of books would be available and sure enough, gathered among diet books and romantic novels was: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/C-How-Program-2nd-Edition/dp/0132261197&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;C How To Program 2nd Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Dietel &amp;amp; Dietel&lt;/em&gt;. This book is likely out of date with best practices for modern C, but what I was looking for was a thorough &lt;em&gt;introduction&lt;/em&gt; to C/C++. This looks like it is what I was looking for. It has pretty good reviews on &lt;em&gt;Amazon&lt;/em&gt; too. I plan on picking up some books on modern best practices after this introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;schedule:881acfa8d42cd3861f49dfee4e7fd53d&#34;&gt;Schedule&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t intend on spending too much time hammering through the entire book. Just a refresher for the first few chapters by skimming through and writing some of the more difficult programs for each chapter. Pointers are presented in Chapter 7, so that&amp;rsquo;s where I&amp;rsquo;ll likely slow down. I know pointers, but my working knowledge of them is lacking. My previous exposure to pointers and working experience in &lt;em&gt;Golang&lt;/em&gt; is useful in some ways, but &lt;em&gt;C/C++&lt;/em&gt; pointers are pretty different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;expectations:881acfa8d42cd3861f49dfee4e7fd53d&#34;&gt;Expectations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I hope to do is get good enough with &lt;em&gt;C/C++&lt;/em&gt; so that it is easier to read source for things like the &lt;em&gt;Linux&lt;/em&gt; kernel and general &lt;em&gt;GNU&lt;/em&gt; utilities. Eventually, I&amp;rsquo;d like to contribute to these types of things. Hopefully this first step is a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
