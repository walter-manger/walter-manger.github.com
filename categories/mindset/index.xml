      <description>I just listened to a very interesting episode of the IndieHackers Podcast that featured Rob Walling.
You can listen to this episode here.
In the episode, Rob shared his humble beginnings and where he is now. As I expected, it was a long road. It was refreshing to hear someone talk about this long road and not resort to &amp;ldquo;How I Lauched A Startup In 24 Hours&amp;rdquo;.</description>
