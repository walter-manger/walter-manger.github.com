This site is generated by a static site generator (SSG) called hugo , but this guide will work with any SSG.
Motivation I wanted to be able to keep raw markdown, and any other files that may be considered private, separate from what is viewable by the public.
Parts A private Github repository to contain your raw markdown and any other assets that may or may not be considered publishable.</description></item><item><title>Golang on Doom Emacs</title><link>https://wmanger.com/articles/go-on-doom-emacs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://wmanger.com/articles/go-on-doom-emacs/</guid><description>Photo by Patrice Schoefolt from Pexels
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to any Golang , but I got the itch this weekend to setup my Doom Emacs to do so.
Most of the time I don&amp;rsquo;t want a full-blown IDE experience as having all the bells and whistles of that type of environment can be distracting.

Many times, especially when working as a freelance developer, you&amp;rsquo;ll need access to multiple Github repositories. Most likely, you will be using different Github accounts, so you&amp;rsquo;ll need to tell git which account to use. To do this, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to configure your ~/.ssh/config and ~/.gitconfig accordingly.
I won&amp;rsquo;t go into great detail in this post, as there already is really good documentation here on how to configure ssh for Github.</description></item><item><title>On becoming a Certified Kubernetes Application Developer</title><link>https://wmanger.com/articles/on-becoming-a-ckad/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://wmanger.com/articles/on-becoming-a-ckad/</guid><description>Over the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been head-down on learning more about Kubernetes. To help solidify this learning, I thought that it would be a good idea to add some icing on the cake and attempt the CKAD exam.
I am glad to report that as of today, I am a Certified Kubernetes Application Developer.
My study strategy wasn&amp;rsquo;t really unique, but I&amp;rsquo;ll describe it below.
Don&amp;rsquo;t Waste Time Don&amp;rsquo;t waste time wondering how long it takes or how much effort it takes to be ready for the exam.</description></item><item><title>How To Know</title><link>https://wmanger.com/articles/how-to-know/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wmanger.com/articles/how-to-know/</guid><description>References https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/bayesianism
