<p>I&rsquo;ve recently starting getting up earlier to work on side projects. When I say earlier, I mean, at about 4:15AM. This should give me a good 1.5 hours to work on something and get to a point that I can commit something meaningful before I have to start getting ready for my day. The goal is to get that number down to something like 40-45 minutes so I can spend the other half doing something else like reading or researching new technologies. What I am finding is for that 1.5 hours to be effective, planning the night before is pretty important. I&rsquo;ve spent a few mornings getting up to speed for a half hour. It&rsquo;s really important to eliminate that discovery time.</p>

<h3 id="what-am-i-working-on:6bb46f5cad8d6c0d6d2277975909ea07">What am I working on?</h3>

<p>When I first wanted to learn Go, I started making a game that could be played in Slack in the form of an integration. It is called <a href="https://github.com/walter-manger/slack-battle">Slack Battle</a>. What I thought would be easy to slap together in a night or so is turning out to be a little more difficult than I&rsquo;d planned. Creating games is difficult &ndash; even really simple ones. Add the requirement for playing games over HTTP and the need for some sort of persistence, and the difficulty increases.</p>

<h3 id="the-new-plan:6bb46f5cad8d6c0d6d2277975909ea07">The <em>New</em> Plan</h3>

<p>The project was first created with Google App Engine, but coming back to the project after it had aged a bit, I thought that it would be so much simpler not being boxed into what GAE offers. Really, the only thing GAE was providing me was a datastore. I decided to use Mongolab instead. Why? Because it doesn&rsquo;t really box me in. It feels as if I had an instance of Mongo running locally.</p>

<ol>
<li>Rip Out GAE</li>
<li>Integrate Mongo &amp; Mongolab</li>
<li>Refactor for better readability and prepare for testing</li>
<li>Add tracking &amp; logging</li>
<li>Actually write tests</li>
<li>Create a front-end for testing (React / Angular)</li>
<li>Deploy to (Digital Ocean, Heroku, &hellip;)</li>
</ol>
