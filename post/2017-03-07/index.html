			 	<h1>Installing Linux Mint &amp; CLI Wonderment</h1>

<p>I decided to install Linux Mint 18 on my old laptop. I really wanted to know what it was like to have a Linux as a primary OS. Initially, I installed a Linux on a VM and having it there was handy, but I found myself not opening the VM. With it installed as my primary OS, I am forced into using it. I&rsquo;ve always been really curious about Linux and how to harness the power &ndash; it&rsquo;s just hard to commit to learning a particular OS when it is not your primary.</p>

<h2 id="tlcl-ftw">TLCL FTW</h2>

<p>Just before I took the plunge, I picked up a physical copy of <em>The Linux Command Line</em> from the local library (it is now late). There is so much great information in that book. You learn little things about the built-in utilities and now basically the OS is an IDE. In the first chapter, the author writes about a scenario where two developers (C++ vs Bash) looking at the same problem solved it in very different ways. Spoiler alert: the Bash approach was orders of magnitude less code. This was the main draw to learning more about Linux.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I can get around Linux pretty well. I just wanted to dig more into the utilities that are available to become more efficient on the command line.</p>

<h2 id="dangerous-thoughts">Dangerous Thoughts</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had pretty good success getting my development environment up and running on Linux. I even scripted out some of the configuration so it can be replicated on other Debian based systems. At this point, I don&rsquo;t see a reason to go elsewhere. In fact, I like this environment so much, I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want to go elsewhere. That&rsquo;s the dangerous thing. I&rsquo;ve always thought that one should be as OS agnostic as possible, but I think when you get exposed to the powerful tools that live in Linux, going outside this environment is difficult. I know that OSX and now Windows 10 have proper support for Bash, but it is here now and it is free.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-audio-other-things">What About Audio &amp; Other Things?</h2>

<p>That is something I am working to try to get to parity with. Currently, OSX and Windows have great support for Audio applications. Not to mention, the VSTs that I&rsquo;ve recently used are so much better than they used to be. I am not opposed to maybe dual-booting for that particular need. We&rsquo;ll see what comes from my digging.</p>
