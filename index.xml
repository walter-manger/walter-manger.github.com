      <description>If you find yourself writing a lot of code for a feature, stop and try to organize your changes into smaller, manageable chunks.
Sure, it takes some discipline, but stopping to actually plan out your work before you do it is worth it because it gives you the headspace to put some genuine thought behind the feature.
There&amp;rsquo;s one caveat &amp;ndash; your company has to appreciate this genuine thought.</description>

This book gives you all the tips you need to become a master Code Craftsman, but it is missing something very important.
Andrew and David don&amp;rsquo;t discuss a programmer&amp;rsquo;s well-being.
Programmers need to take care of themselves - their physical and mental health, relationships, and finances.</description>

      <description>Cloud architecture is a great way to ship safe, cost effective, resilient, and scalable applications.
Here are some tips from the trenches to help your team embrace the cloud.
Trust Your Cloud Provider If you are going to be using the cloud, you need to trust that your provider&amp;rsquo;s services are going to be operational. Writing code defensively or testing that a particular service is working is a waste of time.</description>
